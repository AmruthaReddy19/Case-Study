This targeted membership would allow casual users to unlock bikes exclusively on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. This strategy aligns with casual riders' weekend-oriented riding patterns, potentially enticing them to transition to a full annual membership for more flexibility during the week.\n\n\"See Our City\" Campaign: Launch a \"See Our City\" campaign specifically aimed at casual users. This campaign could include 52 suggested bike routes covering all major sights in the city, with one route for each weekend of the year. By renting bikes for these curated routes, casual riders could explore the city's attractions over the course of a year while also enjoying cost savings compared to individual rentals. This campaign could encourage frequent weekend riders to commit to a full annual membership.\n\nSummer Marketing Emphasis: Ensure that marketing campaigns are timed to coincide with the peak riding activity, which is in the summer. Consider launching promotional offers, discounts, or special events during the summer months to attract both casual riders and members. Highlight the benefits of riding during this season, such as pleasant weather and longer daylight hours, to encourage increased ridership and membership conversions.\n\nThese recommendations leverage the observed differences in riding behavior between casual users and members to tailor marketing strategies that could enhance user engagement, loyalty, and membership conversion.","metadata":{}}]}
